	~~~ ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS / NOTES ~~~
	This color theme was created using the "Daylight" scheme by
	Tobias Marczewski as a starting point for constructing the XML:
	https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/StyleSchemes
	
	The colors were influenced by Yorick Peterse's vim-paper theme:
	https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/vim-paper
	
	... as well as the Pen-Paper-Coffee theme for VS Code
